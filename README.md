EchoChamber
===========

A peer-to-peer app for friends listening to playlists together

Let's say you and some friends all loved [Fun.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_(band\)), and they just came out with a new album.  You guys might want to experience the album for the first time together.  It can be kind of a pain to sync up your music across multiple computers though (especially if you don't both have Spotify Premium).  EchoChamber solves this problem.

The BillBoard Top 100 Challenge
-------------------------------

The BillBoard Top 100 list is truly painful to listen to in order.  Generally after the first 20 it becomes a totally inconsistent mix of rap and country that literally no one appreciates.  That's exactly why you should use an app like EchoChamber to see who (between you and a friend) can stand to listen to more songs before giving up

Development Goals
=================

This app will be made during TartanHacks 2014.  In order, our goals are as follows:

1. Win first place in the alumni division of TartanHacks
2. Convince ScottyLabs that there is an alumni division of TartanHacks
3. Have entierly too much fun with the idea
4. Build something that works for playlists
5. Use as many of the APIs advertised by TartanHacks sponsors as possible, and hopfully a few more than are possible
6. Get more alumni to sign up for the team

EchoChamber
===========

EchoChamber is a social-local-mobile peer-to-peer platform which allows you and some friends to listen to a Spotify playlist synchronously across multiple machines.  If you hit pause, the music is paused across all machines.  If you adjust the song position backward or forward a couple seconds, the song position is adjusted on all machines.  If you get an ad, everyone else's players will pause until your ad is finished.

This allows for an avant-garde, micro-social, music appreciation phenomenon.  Now you and a friend can experience and discuss the exact same music, in real time, across any distance.

The Billboard Hot 100 Challenge
-------------------------------

The Billboard Hot 100 list is truly painful to listen to.  Generally after the first 20-ish songs it becomes a totally inconsistent mix of rap and country that literally no one appreciates.  That's exactly why you should use an app like EchoChamber to see who can stand to listen to more songs before giving up

Our lame competitors
--------------------

There is already a Spotify app called Soundrop, which lets people collaboratively build music queues.  But the music queues are generally out of sync, so you lose the whole shared music experience!  Lame.

Development Goals
=================

This app will be made during TartanHacks 2014 (January 31 - February 1).  In order, our goals are as follows:

1. Use as many buzzwords as possible
2. Win first place in the alumni division of TartanHacks
3. Convince ScottyLabs that there is an alumni division of TartanHacks
4. Build something that mostly works (for playlists at least)
5. Use as many of the TartanHacks sponsors' APIs as possible, and hopefully a few more than are possible
6. Get more alumni to sign up for the team

EchoChamber
===========

EchoChamber is a social-local-mobile peer-to-peer platform which allows you and some friends to listen to a Spotify playlist synchronously across multiple machines.  If you hit pause, the music is paused across all machines.  If you adjust the song position backward or forward a couple seconds, the song position is adjusted on all machines.  If you get an ad, everyone else's players will pause until your ad is finished.

This allows for an avant-garde, micro-social, music appreciation phenomenon.  Now you and a friend can experience and discuss the exact same music, in real time, across any distance.

This app will be made during TartanHacks 2014 (January 31 - February 1).

### The Billboard Hot 100 Challenge

The Billboard Hot 100 list is truly painful to listen to.  Generally after the first 20-ish songs it becomes a totally inconsistent mix of rap and country that literally no one appreciates.  That's exactly why you should use an app like EchoChamber to see who can stand to listen to more songs before giving up

Development Philosophy
======================

* **Release early and often.**  We hope to have version 1 finished within 24 hours of when we start coding
* **Hyper-agile** Our product cycles are measured in hours, not days or months
* **Move fast and break things.** We will probably use the facebook login API
* **Don't be evil.** We will not make people use Google+
* **Work distributed.** Amy is going to be in NYC for most of the hackathon
* **No fixed hours.** Amy will also be busy most of the time she's in NYC
* **Work asynchronously.** So it's important that Amy never be a blocking factor
* **No managers.** This philosophy has worked with two employees, and we think it can scale to three, or even four
* **No meetings.** All discussion can happen over chat

Development Goals
=================

In order, our goals are as follows:

1. Use as many buzzwords as possible
2. Win first place in the alumni division of TartanHacks
3. Convince ScottyLabs that there is an alumni division of TartanHacks
4. Build something that mostly works (for playlists at least)
5. Use as many of the TartanHacks sponsors' APIs as possible, and maybe even a few more than that
6. Get more alumni to sign up for the team

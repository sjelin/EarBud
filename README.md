A peer-to-peer app for friends listening to playlists together

Let's say you and some friends all loved [Fun.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_(band)), and they just came out with a new album.  You guys might want to experience the album for the first time together.  It can be kind of a pain to sync up your music accross multiple computers though.  Togethr solves this problem.
